Toilet Paper Roll Counter Box

## Why
As I was sitting on the toilet the other day, I discovered we had no toilet paper left. Luckily I survived the event, but figured that this could never happen again!

Therefore I made a box that counts the number of toilet paper rolls, which also warns me if we're running low. Everything done with the help from [Home Assistant](https://www.home-assistant.io/) and [ESPHome](https://esphome.io/) ðŸŽ‰ðŸ¤©

If we have less than 4 rolls, we get a subtle warning from the box

And if we have less than 2(!) rolls left, the box goes into EMERGENCY modeðŸš¨ðŸš¨ðŸš¨

## Build
Built this using:
* [NodeMCU](http://www.nodemcu.com/index_en.html) V3
* HX711 and a load cell
* Gilde Box
* [Clas Ohlson Wooden Box](https://www.clasohlson.com/no/Trekasse-med-h%C3%A5ndtak/Pr441449000)
* 12V PSU
* Barrel Socket
* WS2812 LED Strip

### Build process
The new box:

Cutting of Gilde for the plate inside the box:

Checked that the plate fits in the box:

The hole for the barrel plug:

Didn't have a drill that fit the barrel plug, so decided to make a bigger hole, and then 3D-print an adapter for the plug:

Mounted the load cell to the plate, and another plate as the bottom:

## Code
The code is made in ESPHome, a super easy way to make code for sensor and other stuff for Home assistant
[Here](https://github.com/petrepa/TPRCB/blob/master/toilet_paper.yaml) it is!
